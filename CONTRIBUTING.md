# Contributing to g_faraday

## 1. Things you will need

- Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
- [git](https://git-scm.com) (used for source version control).
- An IDE such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 2. Forking & cloning the repository

- Ensure all the dependencies described in the previous section are installed.
- Fork `https://github.com/gfaraday/g_faraday` into your own GitHub account. If
  you already have a fork, and are now installing a development environment on
  a new machine, make sure you've updated your fork so that you don't use stale
  configuration options from long ago.
- `git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/g_faraday.git`
- `git remote add upstream git@github.com:g_faraday/g_faraday.git` (So that you
  fetch from the master repository, not your clone, when running `git fetch`
  et al.)
